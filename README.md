# Shepards tone in Sonic-pi

[Shepard tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone) are auditory
illusion wherein a sequence of notes seem to be infinitely rising or falling
in pitch.

Shepard tones appear as the result of a superposition of multiple rising
sequences of notes with varying intensity.

A rising shepard tone in sonic-pi is available in `shepard.sonic-pi`. Each
part of the implementation is commented inline.

Recordings are available as mp3 files.
